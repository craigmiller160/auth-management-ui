    And the client config tab is selected with these values for "new" client
      | name       | accessTimeout | refreshTimeout | codeTimeout | enabled | clientSecretPlaceholder | useSavedClientKey | clientKey |
      | New Client | 300           | 3600           | 60          | true    | false                   | false             |           |
    And the client config page contains these redirect uris
      | uri |
    When I click the save button
    Then the client is saved successfully
    And the client config tab is selected with these values for "existing" client
      | name       | accessTimeout | refreshTimeout | codeTimeout | enabled | clientSecretPlaceholder | useSavedClientKey | clientKey |
      | New Client | 300           | 3600           | 60          | true    | true                    | true              |           |
    And the client config page contains these redirect uris
      | uri |
    And I click on the clients link
    Then I am on the clients page
    And the list "does" contain a client with the name "New Client"

      | uri                            |
      | https://localhost:123/authcode |
    Then I generate a new client "clientKey"
    Then I generate a new client "clientSecret"
    Then I set the following client config values
      | name          | accessTimeout | refreshTimeout | codeTimeout | enabled |
      | Test Client 2 | 40            | 50             | 60          | true    |
    # TODO add, edit, and remove redirect URIs
    When I click the save button
    Then the client is saved successfully
    And the client config tab is selected with these values for "existing" client

    # TODO test for redirect URIs separately
